# CoChat
CoChat is a programmed client-server communication application using C language and socket programming. We created a multi-user chat room, 'Cozy Chat', where users can log in or register. This chat room offers basic chatting functionalities and operates across different computers once they are successfully pinged. User information is stored securely. We support basic functions like one-to-one chatting, group chats, exit, and account deletion. All user messages in the common chat room are synchronized. Additionally, we implemented numerous user-friendly UI prompts for errors such as incorrect account credentials, inability to find chat partners, and reconfirming before permanently deleting the account.
